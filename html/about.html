                <th id="desc">Responsible for financial management of the organization
                  and well being through fundraising, distribution of funds,
                  record & book keeping, liaising with ACM chairs about financial
                  matters, and advising the organization on financial growth.
                  Through various meetings with department heads and
                  presentations to the Engineering Student Council, I acquired
                  several long term technologies and assets to benefit ACM and
                  the greater KU engineering community.
                </th>
                <th id="desc">In my spare time I enjoy movies, TV
                  shows, photography, various informational or historical podcasts,
                  music, playing video games, and more recently learning about
                  design. I have kept busy throughout the years by working since
                  I was 14 years old, something my dad instilled into me at a
                  young age, helping me discover my varied and wide range of hobbies.
                  Through work experience, I found I preform best in team-oriented
                  atmospheres leading by example and having the ability
                  to see the broad scope of the project or goal.
                </th>
                <th id="desc">Working alongside multiple fraternity brothers,
                  the Standards Board has taught me how to deal with individuals
                  to figure out a solution that works for both them and the board
                  <br><br> Alumni and Family Relations gives me the
                  opportunity to involve family members and KU Alumni into
                  the lives of Alpha Sigma Phi members, developing strong ties
                  with those who have left and coordinating events to
                  improve relationships.
